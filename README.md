# Vision Transformer with Token Merging using Bipartite Soft Merging

This repository contains an implementation of Vision Transformers (ViT) with a token merging mechanism using Bipartite Soft Merging from the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09461. The objective is to enhance the throughput of Vision Transformers by merging tokens in an adaptive manner.

## Introduction


## Features

- **Vision Transformer (ViT) Implementation**: Based on the original ViT architecture.
- **Bipartite Soft Merging**:merge tokens effectively, reducing computational load.


## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ctrl408/ViT-implementations.git
cd ViT-implementations
```
